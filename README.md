Netflix Data Analysis using Python (Pandas,matplotlib,seaborn):
This project involves exploring and analyzing a Netflix dataset to uncover key insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. Using Python’s Pandas library, the data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to identify patterns such as the distribution of content by type, country, release year, and genre. The project also highlights trends in content production over time, the dominance of certain genres, and country-specific contributions. The analysis helps understand Netflix’s content strategy and user preferences through data-driven insights.
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights about the streaming platform’s movies and TV shows. By leveraging the power of Python, Pandas, NumPy, and data visualization libraries, the project aims to understand trends, patterns, and the overall content strategy of Netflix over the years.
